# Pune_Metro_Navigation_System_Project

Developed a navigation system for Pune Metro using graph structures, enabling quicker route mapping and efficient
travel planning
• Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm with heaps to compute the shortest and most efficient metro routes, reducing the
time required for route search and selection..
• Designed features to minimize interchanges between metro lines and interactive user interface.
